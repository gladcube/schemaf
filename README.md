## Usage

#### apply
Apply the "schema" (the object that has keys and "Caster" objects as value) to the any other object.
When the schema is applied, the object's keys that don't exists in the schema will be deleted, and value's type will be casted to the type that defined with "Caster".
This will let the object values valid on MongoDB.
